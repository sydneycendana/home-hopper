# Fullstack Airbnb Clone

Welcome to my Fullstack Airbnb Clone project! This application is my first major application meant to mimick a partially functional clone of the popular Airbnb platform.

## Introduction

Creating my first fullstack application was a thrilling undertaking for me as a new developer. This project challenged me to push my skills to the limit and learn new technologies and techniques along the way. I spent countless hours debugging and reading documentation, and encountered many mishaps that I can now look back on with a smile (and still a bit of frustration).

The end result is an engaging, fully-featured application that I'm excited to share with the world. With this Fullstack Airbnb Clone, users can browse "Airbnb" and interact with different homes as if through a familiar and intuitive interface. I'm proud to have created my first fullstack application that serves as a showcase for my skills and abilities.
