# Fullstack Airbnb Clone

Welcome to Home Hopper! This is my first full stack project meant to mimick a partially functional clone of the popular Airbnb platform. Users can create an account, list a place to stay, and add reviews for other people's places. Here is the link to the <a href="https://home-hopper.onrender.com/" target="_blank">live site</a>.

## Introduction

Creating my first fullstack application was a thrilling undertaking for me as a new developer. This project challenged me to push my skills to the limit and learn new technologies and techniques. I spent countless hours debugging and reading documentation, and encountered many mishaps that I can now look back on with pride.

The end result is an engaging application that I'm excited to share with the world. With Home Hopper, users can browse and interact with different homes as if through a familiar and intuitive interface.
